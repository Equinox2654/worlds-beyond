            <p>In the lands beyond exists a species unlike any other: the vampire. They are faster and stronger than mere humans, and gifted with supernatural abilities. The vampire often appears as a blur in front of humans.</p>
            <h1>Restrictions</h1>
            <p>You must ask permision before entering a home. It is only considered a home when it is completed. You cannot enter a church otherwise you burn to ashes. You do not have a shadow. You are unable to cross moving bodies of water.</p>
            <h1>Vampiric Powers</h1>
            <p>Vampiric traits:</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Ability Score Increase: </strong>Your Strength and Charisma score increases by 2.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Age: </strong>Vampires don't age like other races. They are live for eternity but are not immortal.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Alignment: </strong>Vampires aren't necessarily evil but they bring out the worst in people, similar to Steve Roger's super soldier syrum.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Size: </strong>Vampires are similar in height to humans.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Speed: </strong>Vampires have a base walk speed of 30 feet but can double their movespeed as an action.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Vampiric Resistance</strong>Vampires can still take crippling damage but will remain on 1hp until stabbed by a wooden stake or exposed to the sun.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Darkvision: </strong>Vampires get 60 extra feet of darkvision.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Languages: </strong>Due to their age vampires can read and write in Common, Vampire and one more language.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Bloodthirst: </strong>You can drain blood and life energy from a willing creature, or one that is grappled by you, incapacitated, or restrained. Make a melee attack against the target. If you hit, you deal 1 piercing damage and 1d6 necrotic damage (2d6 at level 5, 3d6 at level 10 and 4d6 at level 12). The target's hit pont maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and you regain hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Vampiric Lunge: </strong>As a vampire, you can leap up to 150 feet. You can do this once per long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Bat Transformation: </strong>Once per short rest or twice per long rest, you gain the ability to turn into a bat. While a bat you can fly at up to 90 feet but cannot dash and flight only lasts a day.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Weaknesses: </strong>When within 10m of large amounts of silver, your character's abilities will be cut in half, lunge distance and bat flight time. If you make contact with silver you take fire damage equal to 1d4 plus your level.
                When your character consumes garlic, you take acid damage equal to 1d4 plus your level. When you are splashed with holy water, you take acid damage equal to 1d8 plus your level. Direct sunlight deals 1d4 fire damage per turn at the end of the turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Fatal Bite: </strong>If your target dies from your bloodthirst ability, they turn into a vampire after 24 hours if the vampire that bit them wants to.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Coffin: </strong>When you take a long rest inside a coffing it takes half as long and you will be fully rejuvinated.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Ancient Storm: </strong>You can summon a storm once every long rest that lasts 1 day.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Crippling Damage: </strong>When at 1hp you are immobile and must take a rest for 24 hours to regain 1 hp back so that you are no longer crippled.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Slowing Descent: </strong>You take no fall damage from high ground.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Blood Bar: </strong>If you do not drink enough blood, you will be left in a crippling state until a willing creature gives you blood. The blood you drink is proportional to the necrotic damage done to the creature.
                At level 1 you must drink 8 points of blood, the amount increases by 1d6 every level. Your blood bar goes down by 1d4 (2d4 at level 5, 3d4 at level 10 and 4d4 at level 12) every morning.</p>
